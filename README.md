# ToDo

To Do application (CRUD) on Angular

The app is written to practice and maintain skills in Angular.

Start data for ToDo is written to a variable in the service by default because I haven't made an API backend with CRUD
operations and database for it yet.

When I do - I will rewrite the service and CRUD methods will be used to interact with it and the database 

So far everything is in the process of development
