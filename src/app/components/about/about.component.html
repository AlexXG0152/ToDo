<div class="my-3">
  <p>The app is written to practice and maintain skills in Angular.</p>
  <p>Start data for ToDo is written to a variable in the service by default because I haven't made an API backend with
    CRUD
    operations and database for it yet.</p>
  <p>When I do - I will rewrite the service and CRUD methods will be used to interact with it and the database
    So far everything is in the process of development</p>
